# Comsil1-Final-Project

This repository contains the final project source codes of mine for the course 'Sogang Computer Engineering Design and Experiments' in the first semester in 2021.

The project program is the maze escape game named 'Where is my Cheese?'.
This program is based on the maze generating Eller's algorithm, the maze escaping Depth First Search, and another needed algorithms to build the maze game. More details are in the PDF file in the same repository.  

* ALERT : If you, the reader is a student who takes the same course and have to do the same assignments, DO NOT COPY this codes. You can refer to the code to help yourself do the homework efficiently, but do not just copying at all.

Actually, this game was developed during the final project of the course 'Sogang Computer Engineering Design and Experiments' in the first semester, 2021.
Since it was a free and personal project, I've created this just by myself, and this game features the maze generating Eller's algorithm, the maze escaping Depth First Search, and another algorithms to build the maze game. 
More details are in the PDF file in the same repository.
